# Hamster Kombat üêπ Key Generator

Welcome to the Hamster Kombat Key Generator repo! This project features a bot that automatically generates keys for the mini-games available within the Hamster Kombat app. The bot is designed to be easy to configure and deploy, providing a seamless way to unlock mini-games.

## Features

- **Automated Key Generation:** Quickly and efficiently generates keys for all available mini-games in the Hamster Kombat app, within minutes which if fairly played would consume hours.
- **Telegram Integration:** Utilizes Telegram MtProto API framework for interaction, including easy setup and management through a Telegram bot.
- **Configurable Settings:** Simple configuration of API credentials and bot settings through the `main.py` file.
- **Open Source and Free:** Licensed under the AGPL, promoting transparency and allowing community contributions.

## Demo

You can try out the demo bot [here](https://t.me/hamster_kombat_hack_keys_bot). Please note that the demo bot is currently hosted locally on my VS Code environment and might be intermittently down. For consistent access, you may need to deploy the bot on a dedicated server.
